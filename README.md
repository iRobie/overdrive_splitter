# overdrive_splitter

This file splits Overdrive audiobook files, and names them according to [Prologue's](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/prologue/id1459223267)
 naming convention.

I really like Overdrive's service. I like the Prologue app better than Overdrives. Hence the conversion.

This is setup to my personal preferences for chapter titles, folder names, etc.
